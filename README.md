The Splunk Plug-in for Eclipse provides tooling that allows you to create projects in the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with the Splunk Enterprise Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java, and for running Java applications that log the application's activity to Splunk.

**Note**: The Java monitoring feature is currently in preview and unsupported.
