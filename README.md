# Splunk plug-in for Eclipse

#### Version 0.1

The Splunk plug-in for Eclipse provides tooling to support creating projects 
with the Splunk SDK for Java.

Splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed
map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search and process large 
time-varying data sets.

The Splunk product is popular with system administrators for aggregation and
monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance and a wide variety of other
scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index, search, analyze and
generate real-time notifications from large volumes of time series data.

The Splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the same
technology used by the Splunk product to build exciting new applications that
are enabled by Splunk's unique capabilities.

## Getting started with the Splunk plug-in for Eclipse

The Splunk plug-in for Eclipse provides extensions to the Eclipse environment
to simplify creating projects using the Splunk SDK for Java. It provides a
new "Splunk SDK for Java" project kind, a set of code templates for common
tasks using the Splunk SDK for Java, and structured editors for Splunk search
commands and time ranges.
